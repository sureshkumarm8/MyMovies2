# MyMovies2
 It fetches themoviedb.org API to display the movies data, that way the content provided is always up-to-date and relevant.

Project Overview
Welcome to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, added additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.
This is Popular Movies Stage 2 of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app that helps users discover popular and top rated movies on the web.


Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(heart).
Created a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
Modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
